# Color-Analysis
The program takes a colored image, and displays various plots of the colors used in the image.
When color_analysis.py is run, it will ask the user to input the name of the image file to be analyzed.
Input the name of the image, including the file extension, (e.g. "image.jpg"). It will then display the following plots:

Histogram that plots the frequency of each hue used
A radial histogram that plots the frequency of each hue used
3D scatter plot that plots each cluster of pixels by its hue, saturation, and value
